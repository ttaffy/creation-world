        <p><b>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</b> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <strong>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</strong> &copy; </p>
        
        <p>It is a long <sub>established</sub> fact that a <sup>reader</sup> will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. <br><br><br><i>Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.</i> Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
